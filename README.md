# Intrusion-Detection

## Usage
 Everyday we take a huge risk by leaving the house unguarded 	:worried: , while we got to work.
 If you have a dog in the house, you can rest in peace :relieved: else this Intrusion-Detection system is the way to go :wink: 

## How to implement the system?

1. Delete the **__pycache__** Folder and install all the modules.
2. Once done capture the images of your face and save it in a folder having your name inside images.
3. Then run the **face_rec.py**
4. This will create an encoding file containing the encodings of your faces to be recognized.
5. Before running the telegram.py, create a telegram bot using Bot Father and update your API in the file.
6. Then run the **telegram.py** and lay back as the program does it's work and saves you from intruders.
